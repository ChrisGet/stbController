Multi format STB/Device Controlller
Author: Christopher Get

#v2.3
Added:
- Disabling/Enabling of sequences. Disabled sequences are not shown on the main controller page list.
- Sequences descriptions. Users can now add descriptions to the sequences so that other users know what they do.
- Sequence description pops up when users hover over the sequence on the main controller page.
- Ability to now control STB groups via the live control interface. Users can toggle between the STB grid or a list of STB groups for live control.
- Helpful alerts when exporting sequences. Alerts will inform users of incorrect web server setup if export file locations (URL) cannot be reached.
- InfraRed control support using RedRat IRNetBoxIV hardware. This includes extra dotnet packages and the RedRatHub in order to communicate with the RedRat hardware.
- InfraRed control support using GlobalCache iTach hardware. SkyQ and NowTV only.
- NowTV network control over IP.
- Sequence categories. Users can now categorise their sequences for easier management. These categories are shown on the sequences page and the STB control page.

Changed:
- Moved to JSON format for storing of STB Groups, Sequences, and Event Schedule data. Conversion is managed by legacyCheck.pl in the scripts directory.
	Other page scripts also run legacy checking sub routines to ensure unconverted data gets converted accordingly.
- Many javascript improvements around UI navigation, ajax requests, error messages, data validation, etc.
- Sequence timeouts are now displayed in a different colour to help distinguish them from actual commands.
- Initial setup script updated to include setup for RedRatHub and IR features.

Fixed:
- Erratic behaviour in divs where content is added dynamically through button presses. Examples of this would be when adding STBs to a group or adding commands to a sequence.
- Many UI improvements and tweaks to fix poor layout, incorrect font sizing, scroll bars where they aren't required, etc.
- Grid creation issue (NEW). On initial grid setup, the grid would not get created. A form serialization technique within stbController.js had stopped working. This method was overkill and clunky anyway, so the method was changed to pass direct values in to the POST request instead.
- Strange placement of "Create New Grid" button which could potentially block user input in to one of the required fields.

#v2.1
Added:
- CPAN module "JSON" required
- Ability to export sequences in both native and stress format.
	REQUIRED: "exports" directory needs a symbolic link within the web server directory for export functionality to work properly.
- Ability to export multiple sequences (Native format only) for importing to other STB controller instances.
- Added support for "Search" and "Apps" Sky Q buttons.

Changed:
- STB data now stored in JSON format rather than resource hungry and clunky .db file.
- Sky Q Bluetooth control commands are now USB HID instead of "trickplayslider" or "touchpad" as they are no longer supported.

Fixed:
- Problematic scroll in controller.css

Removed:
- DBM::Deep CPAN module reference in README.txt. Module is still used for conversion when upgrading but nowhere else.

#v1.0 
- First version of STB controller.
